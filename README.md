PayFile
=======

Mike Hearn <mhearn@bitcoinfoundation.org>

PayFile is a set of three apps showing how to build a simple file server and download client that uses Bitcoin micropayment channels to incrementally pay for each chunk of data.

It provides a server, a simple console client and a JavaFX2 based GUI. The GUI is designed to act as both a very simple file browser/downloader and also a standalone wallet that money can be loaded into/out of. It's based on the "wallet template" app found inside the source code for the bitcoinj library.

Current status: incomplete and not yet ready for public announcement. This repository is just acting as a backup area until the project is further along. There is a TODO list in the Main.java file of the GUI client.
